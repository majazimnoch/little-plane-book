# little-plane-book

This is a hobby project dedicated to one of my many passions: planes! I want to grow this project gradually, simultanously with my knowledge about aviation.

## tech stuff
I'm using Vue, Vue Router, createWebHistory. 

Router is used to created routes for my pages. To wrap text as a link and routes I'm suing router-link. To display a chosen page, section consists of router-view.
